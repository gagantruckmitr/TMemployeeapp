This file contains the continuation code for Managers.jsx

Replace the old grid section with this comprehensive implementation that includes:
- Manager cards with detailed stats
- Team performance metrics
- Mini trend charts
- Detailed view modal with full information
- Add/Edit/Delete functionality
- World-class UI/UX matching the Telecallers page

The code is too long to fit in one replacement, so it needs to be applied in sections.
